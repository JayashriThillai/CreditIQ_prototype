 CreditIQ — AI-Powered Behavioral Credit Intelligence Platform

## Overview

CreditIQ is a prototype developed for the **Hack-O-Hire 2026 Hackathon** under the theme *AI-Powered Alternate Credit Scoring*.
The platform demonstrates how alternative behavioral financial data can be used to generate a transparent, AI-driven credit score for individuals and MSMEs who lack traditional credit histories.
Unlike conventional credit scoring systems that rely only on loan or credit-card history, CreditIQ evaluates real financial behavior such as income stability, bill payment regularity, transaction consistency, spending discipline, and digital activity.

##  Problem Statement

Millions of individuals and small businesses are financially excluded due to the absence of formal credit history. Traditional scoring models fail to assess the true repayment capacity of these new-to-credit borrowers.
This project proposes a behavioral AI-based credit scoring system to improve financial inclusion while maintaining responsible risk-based lending.

##  Key Features

*  Behavioral Credit Score (300–850 scale)
*  AI-Based Risk Classification (Low / Medium / High)
*  Repayment Probability Estimation
*  Smart Loan Recommendation Engine
*  SHAP-Inspired Explainable AI Visualization
*  Interactive Dashboard & Credit Report
*  Personalized Loan Offers Section

##  How It Works

1. User inputs behavioral financial indicators.
2. Weighted scoring logic simulates an ensemble AI model (Random Forest + XGBoost concept).
3. System generates:
   * Credit Score
   * Risk Level
   * Repayment Probability
   * Recommended Loan Limit
4. Explainability module visualizes feature contributions.
5. Loan recommendation engine suggests suitable credit products.

##  Tech Stack
